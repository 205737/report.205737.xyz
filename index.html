      <h2>5.  Evaluation</h2>
      <p>As a whole project I am really proud of it. I am happy I was not only able to source that data I wanted but it gave us some information on how Irelands network speeds are improving. I think I did really well with cleaning my data. I had a lot of bumps in the road with getting the rows and columns I needed but eventually I got it figured out.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There are definitely some improvements I would make if I were to do something similar. I think the biggest disappointment for me is the fact that the interactive graphs on the website have to open to a new tab. I did try to embed my navigation and footer into them but it was taking up too much time. I do really think that it would have helped make the website more fulfilling if a new tab didnâ€™t open every time you wanted to view my data.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Another thing I think that will help make it more doable again would be to highlight all the different things my python cleaning code needed to contain. I just started cleaning my data and used whatever made sense to clean it. When I was reporting on my code, I had to go through and pick out the bits that I could say I used like list or boolean statements. I did however have most of the requirements and there were only a few things that I needed to tweak to fit the brief.</p>
