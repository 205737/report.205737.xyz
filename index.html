      <h2>2.  Investigation</h2>
      <br>
      <p>I knew that I wanted to base my data around networking in some sort of way. I am currently on the waiting list to get fibre. This inspired me to look into how the network speed across Ireland has been affected by the roll out of fibre. I Google for data on how many properties are connected to the fibre network or average speeds in the home. I looked at nbi.ie, comreg.ie and a few European data sites. No luck. I decided to email the NBI as they have helped me out before. Unfortunately they weren’t able to help me out. So I emailed ComReg and I was in luck! At first they said that what I was looking for wasn’t their department but they forward my email on and I got this back. </p>

      <p>Hi [name],
      <p>Thanks for your query.</p><p>
      <p>The following dataset which we publish on our website should assist you with your project - All-Data-Q3-2024_v2.xlsx</p>
      <p>On the Broadband tab</p>
      <p>1 Row 12 “Total Fixed Broadband Subscriber Lines” is the number of active broadband lines (i.e. those who are paying for a subscription), lines 6 to 11 break this figure down by  the different broadband platforms (e.g. FTTP = Fibre to the Premises i.e. Full Fibre, ADSL = Copper, VDSL = Part Copper/Part Fibre).</p>
      <p>2. Row 36 “ Fixed Residential & Business Subscriber Lines by Sold Download Speed’ provides information on what speeds the lines are sold at.</p>
      <p>3. Row 66 “Fixed Broadband Subscriber Lines by Sold Download Speeds” gives a percentage breakdown on fixed broadband subscriber lines by speed which shows how speeds have changed over time.</p>
      <p>The tab 5.1 Broadband Coverage also may be of interest as this shows the % of Eircodes which have fibre available, there are also some charts in the final tab which you may be able to reuse.</p>
      <p>Hope this helps, let me know if you have any further questions.</p>

      <p>After a quick peep, I knew I had enough data for my project and to conduct my data analysis on. I decided that I would base my data of the FTTP, Total</p>

      <h2>3.  Plan & Design</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I will have charts that show how the rollout of fibre broadband has affected the average speed for the consumer.</li>
        <li>I will have charts that can be interacted with to help analyse the data further.</li>
        <li>I will get my data from a source like NBI so that I can not only trust it but so it would be publicly available.</li>
        <li>I will use GitHub to host my website so that not only can I easily view the final result but I can then easily download the files to be placed into my artefacts folder.</li>
        <li>I will follow a flowchart to create my website and to analyse my data.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5.  Evaluation</h2>
      <br>
      <p>As a whole project I am really proud of it. I am happy I was not only able to source that data I wanted but it gave us some information on how Irelands network speeds are improving. I think I did really well with cleaning my data. I had a lot of bumps in the road with getting the rows and columns I needed but eventually I got it figured out.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There are definitely some improvements I would make if I were to do something similar. I think the biggest disappointment for me is the fact that the interactive graphs on the website have to open to a new tab. I did try to embed my navigation and footer into them but it was taking up too much time. I do really think that it would have helped make the website more fulfilling if a new tab didn’t open every time you wanted to view my data.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Another thing I think that will help make it more doable again would be to highlight all the different things my python cleaning code needed to contain. I just started cleaning my data and used whatever made sense to clean it. When I was reporting on my code, I had to go through and pick out the bits that I could say I used like list or boolean statements. I did however have most of the requirements and there were only a few things that I needed to tweak to fit the brief.</p>
